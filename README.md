## 🧪 AI Workflow Overview

The visuals shown on this site are generated using a multi-stage pipeline:

```
Prompt → ControlNet (Depth/Hand Pose) → LoRA (Style/Subject) → SDXL Render → GFPGAN / Inpainting → SadTalker (Optional Video) → Final Output
```

Automation scripts were developed in Python for batch processing and optimization on CUDA-capable GPUs.
